 *	  or cheaper cost (on either dimension) than any of the existing old paths
 *	  that have the same or superset required_outer rels.
 *
 *	  We also remove from the rel's pathlist any old paths that are dominated
 *	  by new_path --- that is, new_path is cheaper, at least as well ordered,
 *	  and requires no outer rels not required by old path.
 *
 *	  There is one policy decision embedded in this function, along with its
 *	  sibling add_path_precheck: we treat all parameterized paths as having
 *	  NIL pathkeys, so that they compete only on cost.  This is to reduce
 *	  the number of parameterized paths that are kept.  See discussion in
 *	  src/backend/optimizer/README.
 *
 *	  The pathlist is kept sorted by total_cost, with cheaper paths
 *	  at the front.  Within this routine, that's simply a speed hack:
 *	  doing it that way makes it more likely that we will reject an inferior
 *	  path after a few comparisons, rather than many comparisons.
 *	  However, add_path_precheck relies on this ordering to exit early
 *	  when possible.
 *
 *	  NOTE: discarded Path objects are immediately pfree'd to reduce planner
 *	  memory consumption.  We dare not try to free the substructure of a Path,
 *	  since much of it may be shared with other Paths or the query tree itself;
 *	  but just recycling discarded Path nodes is a very useful savings in
 *	  a large join tree.  We can recycle the List nodes of pathlist, too.
 *
 *	  BUT: we do not pfree IndexPath objects, since they may be referenced as
 *	  children of BitmapHeapPaths as well as being paths in their own right.
 *
 * 'parent_rel' is the relation entry to which the path corresponds.
 * 'new_path' is a potential path for parent_rel.
